1. Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

A single unit test would be insufficient to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. This is because the feature potentially contains multiple moving parts that need to be isolated and unit tested on individually.

2. Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging app. This is because the feature likely doesn't interact with other features and is an isolated component of the messaging process.
